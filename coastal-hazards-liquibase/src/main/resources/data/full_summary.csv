"2","These data sets contain information on the probabilities of hurricane-induced erosion (collision, inundation and overwash) for each 1-km section of the Gulf of Mexico coast for category 1-5 hurricanes. The analysis is based on a storm-impact scaling model that uses observations of beach morphology combined with sophisticated hydrodynamic models to predict how the coast will respond to the direct landfall of category 1-5 hurricanes. Hurricane-induced water levels, due to both surge and waves, are compared to beach and dune elevations to determine the probabilities of three types of coastal change: collision (dune erosion), overwash, and inundation. Data on dune morphology (dune crest and toe elevation) and hydrodynamics (storm surge, wave setup and runup) are also included in this data set. As new beach morphology observations and storm predictions become available, this analysis will be updated to describe how coastal vulnerability to storms will vary in the future.

Consequently there is a need to develop modeling or other analytical approaches that can be used to evaluate potential impacts to inform coastal management. This shapefile provides the data that were used to develop and evaluate the performance of a Bayesian network (BN) that was developed to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea-level rise. The data consist of information compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. Atlantic coast. In this work, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response which are represented by observations of local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. Using this information, the BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea-level rise rates.","Bayesian probability (%) of shoreline change < -2 m/yr (erosion) for Atlantic Coast"

"3158","The goal of this project is to provide a preliminary overview, at a National scale, the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea- level rise through the use of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI). This initial classification is based upon the variables geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height, relative sea-level rise and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise.","Coastal vulnerability to waves for Gulf of Mexico U.S."
"1123","This dataset includes shorelines from 22 years ranging from 1836 to 2000 in the New Jersey North coastal region from Sandy Hook to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Shorelines were compiled from T-sheets (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), T-sheets and air photos (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection), and lidar (USGS). . Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Assessment Project. Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.1. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.","The Historical locations element of NewJerseyN_shorelines.shp - Shorelines of the New Jersey North coastal region used in shoreline change analysis from Sandy Hook to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey"

"2025","This dataset includes shorelines from 22 years ranging from 1836 to 2000 in the New Jersey North coastal region from Sandy Hook to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Shorelines were compiled from T-sheets (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), T-sheets and air photos (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection), and lidar (USGS). . Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Assessment Project. Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.1. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.","The Historical locations element of NewJerseyN_shorelines.shp - Shorelines of the New Jersey North coastal region used in shoreline change analysis from Sandy Hook to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey"

"2610","During the 21st century, sea-level rise will have a wide range of effects on coastal environments, human development and infrastructure in coastal areas. Consequently there is a need to develop modeling or other analytical approaches that can be used to evaluate potential impacts to inform coastal management. This shapefile provides the data that were used to develop and evaluate the performance of a Bayesian network (BN) that was developed to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea-level rise. The data consist of information compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. Atlantic coast. In this work, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response which are represented by observations of local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. Using this information, the BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea-level rise rates.","Geomorphic Risk for Atlantic Coast"
