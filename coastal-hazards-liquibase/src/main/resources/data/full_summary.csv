"2539","This data defines potential hurricane-induced coastal erosion hazards for the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia coastline using pre-storm forecasts for Hurricane Sandy. The analysis is based on a storm-impact scaling model that uses observations of beach morphology combined with sophisticated hydrodynamic models to predict how the coast will potentially respond to the direct landfall of Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane-induced water levels, due to both surge and wave run-up, are compared to beach and dune elevations to determine the probabilities of three types of coastal change: collision (dune erosion), overwash, and inundation.","The collision element of Hurricane Sandy Assessment of Potential Coastal-Change Impacts"
