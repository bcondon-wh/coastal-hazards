"2","Hurricanes, nor'easters, and Pacific winter storms are powerful events that generate dangerous waves and surge capable of moving large amounts of sand, destroying buildings and infrastructure, and even taking lives. Through processes like dune erosion, overwash, and inundation, storms reshape our nation's coastline. The storm impacts component of National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards (NACCH) focuses on understanding the magnitude and variability of extreme storm impacts on sandy beaches. Real-time and scenario-based predictions of storm-induced coastal change, as well as the supporting data, are provided to support management of coastal infrastructure, resources, and safety.","Extreme Storms and Hurricanes"
"3","Coastal erosion is a widespread process along most open-ocean shores of the United States that affects both developed and natural coastlines. As the coast changes, there are a wide range of ways that change can affect coastal communities, habitats, and the physical characteristics of the coast-including beach erosion, shoreline retreat, land loss, and damage to infrastructure.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for conducting research on coastal change hazards, understanding the processes that cause coastal change, and developing models to forecast future change. To understand and adapt to shoreline change, accurate information regarding the past and present configurations of the shoreline is essential. A comprehensive, nationally consistent analysis of shoreline movement is needed.  To meet this national need, the USGS is conducting an analysis of historical shoreline changes along open-ocean coasts of the United States and parts of the Great Lakes. As more data are gathered, periodic updates are made, which provide information that can be used in multidisciplinary assessments of global change impacts.","Shoreline change: Historical shoreline positions and rates of change along ocean shorelines of the United States."
"4","The general nature of the changes that can occur on ocean coasts in response to sea-level rise are widely recognized. It is difficult, however, to forecast exactly what changes may occur in response to a specific rise in sea level at a particular location or point in time. The ability to forecast the extent of these changes is limited by uncertainties in both currently available data that describes the coastal environment, as well as gaps in understanding of some of the driving processes that contribute to coastal change. Nonetheless, coastal managers need actionable information to make decisions to avoid, mitigate, or adapt to future hazards.  The USGS has developed two methods that describe the vulnerability of a coastal region to sea-level rise: a Coastal Vulnerability Index, and probabilistic assessment of shoreline change that uses a Bayesian network approach.","Sea-level Rise"
