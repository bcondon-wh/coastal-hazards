Fundamentally disturbance driven systems, barrier islands and their endemic biota are continually shaped by physical forces on a time scale vastly accelerated in comparison to mainland systems. Because of the rapid pace and scope of change, long term monitoring is crucial towards understanding natural barrier island conditions as well as anthropogenic influences.</purpose><supplinf>A merged file exists for all years in one shapefile available online at http://science.nature.nps.gov/nrdata/.

Monitoring of weather over the period leading up to collection, monitoring of regional real-time tide levels as observed against predictions (and subsequent extrapolation to OC), and visual observations are all used to predict a best day.

On days of data collection, a GPS position is taken of a known point - a permanent monument - and the collected position is compared to the known coordinates to insure accuracy.  All collected files are normally differentially corrected using the base station files from NJDEP, Trenton, NJ.  NJDEP files were not used in this instance because the known point was collected after 20:00 EDT - the stopping point of NJDEP file collection.  Base station correction files were instead obtained from VIMS (per recommendation of the NPS CRGIS base station site, which was unavailable for the time period).  The accuracy of the Northing and Easting coordinates was sub-meter for this survey.

A note on file editing: in summer 2002, the GIS/Geomorphology section of ASIS-NRM instituted new shoreline processing procedures.  This file was processed using these general guidelines to editing: Check for errors by scrolling one frame at a time through the entire map at a 1:2,000 Scale.  Gaps of 5 meters or less can be joined as long as you are certain they were unintentional/errors, and not true features (like a temporary stream/inlet).  Use great care in joining and if you are adding vertices; try to mimic natural line-flow as best as possible.  Obviously unintentional clustering (E.g., explained by points taken while standing still) of non-line points should be cleared up by deleting carefully chosen points.</attraccr></attracc><logic>The file was checked at 1:2000 for topological inconsistency in the line.  All inconsistent topology was amended.  Gaps are present and have not been amended.  Multiple data points were deleted. Topology created for this data set includes Lines Must Not Overlap and Lines Must Not Intersect.

All positions were post-processed and 68% precisions did not exceed 1 meter.  Positions were collected at known reference points during each survey.  These positions were compared with the published coordinates of the reference points and did not vary more than 1 meter horizontal distance from the published location.

For the purposes of this monitoring program, the actual ocean "shoreline" was defined as the average position of the most recent high tide, evidenced by the obvious wet/dry sand line or deposited wrack.  The ProXH GPS receiver was configured to record positions at a very short interval (1 position every 5 meters) for the best representation of the shoreline position.  This survey (Ocean) was conducted shortly after the daily high tide at the Lewes Delaware Water Level Station (8557380). (20070709: 3.96 ft at 0418)  Mean normal high tide at Lewes Delaware is 4.08 feet.  

Logical consistency was checked in Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office.  The zephyr antenna was mounted on the right side of the ATV.  

Data were differentially corrected post-survey using the Trimble H-star post-processing method.  Base stations included were as follows:
