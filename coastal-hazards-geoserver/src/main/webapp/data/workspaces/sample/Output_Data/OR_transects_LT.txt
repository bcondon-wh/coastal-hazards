  Description:
    Abstract:
      Sandy ocean beaches are a popular recreational destination, often surrounded by communities containing valuable real estate.  Development is on the rise despite the fact that coastal infrastructure is subjected to flooding and erosion.  As a result, there is an increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present shoreline changes.  To meet these national needs, the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is compiling existing reliable historical shoreline data along open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Alaska and Hawaii under the National Assessment of Shoreline Change project.

      There is no widely accepted standard for analyzing shoreline change.  Existing shoreline data measurements and rate calculation methods vary from study to study and prevent combining results into state-wide or regional assessments.  The impetus behind the National Assessment project was to develop a standardized method of measuring changes in shoreline position that is consistent from coast to coast.  The goal was to facilitate the process of periodically and systematically updating the results in an internally consistent manner.
    Purpose: This dataset consists of long-term (100+ years) shoreline change rates for the Oregon coastal region.  Rate calculations were computed within a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.2, an ArcGIS extension developed by the U.S. Geological Survey.  Long-term rates of shoreline change were calculated using a linear regression rate based on available shoreline data.  A reference baseline was used as the originating point for the orthogonal transects cast by the DSAS software. The transects intersect each shoreline establishing measurement points, which are then used to calculate long-term rates.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The attributes of this dataset are based on the field requirements of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System and were automatically generated by the software during the generation of the transect layer or during the calculation of shoreline change rates performed by the software.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: These data were generated using DSAS v4.2, an automated software program which does not perform checks for fidelity of the input features. The transects were visually inspected and sometimes manually adjusted within a standard ArcMap edit session to adjust the position at which an individual transect intersected the shorelines.
  Completeness_Report: This dataset contains the transects automatically generated by the DSAS software application that were used to calculate long-term shoreline change rates for the region.  Additional transects may have been generated but did not intersect the minimum requirement of four shorelines, one of which must be the lidar-derived shoreline, to calculate long-term rates.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: LRR
      Attribute_Definition: A linear regression rate-of-change statistic was calculated by fitting a least-squares regression line to all shoreline points for a particular transect. The best-fit regression line is placed so that the sum of the squared residuals (determined by squaring the offset distance of each data point from the regression line and adding the squared residuals together) is minimized. The linear regression rate is the slope of the line.  The rate is reported in meters per year with positive values indicating accretion and negative values indicating erosion.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: LR2
      Attribute_Definition: The R-squared statistic, or coefficient of determination, is the percentage of variance in the data that is explained by a regression. It is a dimensionless index that ranges from 1.0 to 0.0 and measures how successfully the best-fit line accounts for variation in the data. The smaller the variability of the residual values around the regression line relative to the overall variability, the better the prediction (and closer the R-squared value is to 1.0).

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: LSE
      Attribute_Definition: The predicted (or estimated) values of y (the distance from baseline in meters) are computed for each shoreline point by using the values of x (the shoreline date) and solving the equation for the best-fit regression line (y=mx+b).  The standard error is also called the standard deviation.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: LCI90
      Attribute_Definition: The standard error of the slope with confidence interval describes the uncertainty of the reported rate. The LRR rates are determined by a best-fit regression line for the shoreline data at each transect. The slope of this line is the reported rate of change (in meters/year). The confidence interval (LCI) is calculated by multiplying the standard error (also called the standard deviation) of the slope by the two-tailed test statistic at the user-specified 90 percent confidence.  This value is often reported in conjunction with the slope to describe the confidence of the reported rate.  For example:  LRR = 1.2 LCI90 = 0.7 could be reported as a rate of 1.2 (+/-) 0.7 meters/year.
